Construction Wands make building easier!

With a Construction Wand you can place multiple blocks (up to 1024) at once, extending you build on the side you're facing.
Sneak+Right click to activate angel mode which allows you to place a block at the opposite side of the block facing you.
If you concentrate enough, you can even conjure a block in mid air!

This is my first minecraft mod. May the odds be ever in your favor.
