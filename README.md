#Construction Wand

With a Construction Wand you can place multiple blocks (up to 1024) at once, extending you build on the side you're facing.
Sneak+Right click to activate angel mode which allows you to place a block at the opposite side of the block facing you.
If you concentrate enough, you can even conjure a block in mid air!

##Wands
There are basic wands made from stone, iron and diamond and the Infinity wand.

| Wand     | Durability  | Max. Blocks | Angel distance |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Stone    | 131         | 9           | No angel mode  |
| Iron     | 250         | 27          | 1              |
| Diamond  | 1561        | 128         | 4              |

##Crafting


##Modes
There are two wand modes: Default and Angel mode. You can switch modes by SHIFT+Right clicking.

**Default mode:** Extends your build on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier. SHIFT+Scroll to change the placement mode (Horizontal, Vertical, Top/Bottom, No lock).

**Angel mode:**Â Places a block on the opposite side of the block (or row of blocks) you are facing. Maximum distance depends on wand tier. Right click empty space to place a block in midair (similar to angel blocks, hence the name). To do that, you'll need to have the block you want to place in your offhand. You can't place a block in midair if you've fallen more than 10 blocks deep (no easy rescue tool from falling into the void).

##Options
Every wand has two additional options that can be changed using keys. (Standard: N / SHIFT+N)

**Placement direction:** If set to "player" the wand places blocks in the same direction as if they were placed by yourself. Target mode places the blocks in the same direction as their supporting block. See the picture below:

**Fluid lock:** Enables/disables the replacement of fluid blocks (both source + flowing).

##Additional features
- If you have shulker boxes in your inventory filled with blocks, the wand can pull them out and place them

- Botania compatibility: The Black Hole Talisman can supply blocks just like shulker boxes can. Having a Rod of the Lands / Rod of the Depths in your inventory will provide you with infinite dirt/cobble at the cost of Mana.

- Holding down SHIFT while looking at a blocks will show you the last blocks you placed with a green frame around them. SHIFT+Right clickking any of them will undo the operation, giving you all the items back.

- Having blocks in your offhand will place them instead of the block you're looking at

- Look at your statisics to see how many blocks you have placed using your wand
